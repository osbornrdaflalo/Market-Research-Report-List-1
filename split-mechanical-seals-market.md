<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Split Mechanical Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pusher Type Seal</li><li>Non-pusher Seal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The split mechanical seals market is categorized into two main types: pusher type seals and non-pusher seals. Pusher type seals feature a dynamic sealing element that compensates for wear and movement, ensuring a tight seal even under fluctuating conditions. In contrast, non-pusher seals lack this dynamic adjustment mechanism, relying on the initial seal strength without compensating for wear. Each type serves specific applications, with pusher seals often favored in environments where maintenance and adjustments are required, while non-pusher seals are typically used in stable operating conditions.</p></p>
