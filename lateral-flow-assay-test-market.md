<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lateral Flow Assay Test Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sandwich Assays</li><li>Competitive Assays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The lateral flow assay test market comprises two main types: sandwich assays and competitive assays. Sandwich assays detect target analytes by using two antibodies, forming a "sandwich" around the analyte, resulting in a visible signal. They are highly sensitive and specific, ideal for applications like pregnancy tests and infectious disease detection. Conversely, competitive assays involve the competition between the analyte and a labeled analogue for binding sites on a specific antibody, often used in drug testing and allergen detection. Both types offer rapid results and ease of use.</p></p>
