<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental X Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Conversion</li><li>Indirect Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental X-ray flat panel detector market is divided into two main types: direct conversion and indirect conversion. Direct conversion detectors use a photoconductor to convert X-rays directly into electrical signals, providing high sensitivity and resolution. In contrast, indirect conversion detectors employ a two-step process, using a scintillator to first convert X-rays into visible light, which is then converted into electrical signals by a photodetector. Both types enhance imaging quality and are crucial in modern dental diagnostics.</p></p>
