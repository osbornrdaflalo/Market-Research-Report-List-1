<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hepatocellular Carcinoma Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemotherapy</li><li>Brachytherapy</li><li>Ablation Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hepatocellular carcinoma drug market encompasses various treatment modalities, including chemotherapy, brachytherapy, and ablation therapy. Chemotherapy employs systemic drugs to target cancer cells, though it is less common for liver cancer. Brachytherapy involves implanting radioactive sources directly into or near the tumor, delivering localized radiation. Ablation therapy utilizes techniques such as radiofrequency or microwave ablation to destroy cancer cells by heating. Each approach offers distinct benefits and is chosen based on tumor characteristics and patient health.</p></p>
