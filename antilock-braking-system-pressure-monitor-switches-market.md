<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antilock Braking System Pressure Monitor Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Closed Switch</li><li>Normally Open Switch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Antilock Braking System (ABS) pressure monitor switches are crucial components that ensure optimal braking performance. The market includes two primary switch types: Normally Closed (NC) switches and Normally Open (NO) switches. NC switches maintain a closed circuit under normal conditions and activate an alert when pressure drops, indicating potential issues. In contrast, NO switches remain open under normal conditions and close to signal an abnormal pressure increase, enabling quicker response to braking system irregularities. Both play essential roles in vehicle safety and performance.</p></p>
