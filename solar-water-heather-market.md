<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Water Heather Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressurized Solar Water Heater</li><li>Non Pressure Solar Water Heater</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar water heater market comprises two main types: pressurized and non-pressurized systems. Pressurized solar water heaters utilize a closed-loop system that maintains water pressure, enabling faster heating and the option for higher elevation installations. They are ideal for high-demand applications. In contrast, non-pressurized systems rely on natural gravitational flow, making them simpler and more cost-effective, but less suitable for high-rise buildings or areas with fluctuating water supply pressure. Both types provide eco-friendly hot water solutions.</p></p>
